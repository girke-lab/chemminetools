description: <p><b>Hierarchical clustering</b> builds agglomeratively a hierarchy of clusters based on pairwise compound similarities defined using the Atom Pair descriptors and Tanimoto coefficiency. Based on how the distance or similarity between two clusters are defined, several <i>linkage</i> methods are defined. For more details on this clustering method, please see the theory section of the <a href="/help">online tutorial.</a></p><p> The result will be presented as a dendrogram.</p>
