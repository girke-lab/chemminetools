description: <b>Binning clustering</b> partitions all the compounds into disjoint <i>bins</i>, and guarantees that every compound has all its neighboring compounds in the same bin. Neighbors are defined as compounds with similarity greater than a user-defined <i>cutoff similarity</i>. For more details on this clustering method, please see the theory section of the <a href="/help">online tutorial.</a>

ApplicationOptions:
     Similarity Cutoff: # this name will show up online
          realName: cutoff # this will be passed to the app
          options: # format: [web name, command line value]
